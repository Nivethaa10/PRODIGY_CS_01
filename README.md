# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

This is a simple Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places.

## 📌 Features

- Encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar Cipher
- Supports both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, spaces) are preserved
- User input for message, shift value, and mode (encrypt/decrypt)

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

The user is prompted to enter:
1. A message
2. A shift value (integer)
3. Mode - either `encrypt` or `decrypt`

The program then processes the text and displays the result.

## 🧪 Example

```bash
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter shift value (integer): 5
Choose mode (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Result: Mjqqt, Btwqi!
